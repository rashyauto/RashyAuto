<h3> Lamborghini has had a history of outrageous cars ever since they forayed from tractors into cars. This mental attitude is what sets them apart from the rest of the modern hi-tech competition. It is actually ironic that Lambos looks 20 years ahead of time, but still packs naturally aspirated V12s (that's slowly changing with a mild-hybrid tech coming in with the Lamborghini Sian FKP 37).</h3>
<P><h3>But among all this buzz, Lamborghini treated itself to something bold, even by 'Lamborghini' standards. The Lamborghini Veneno looked unreal to exist and be out on public roads, and only 3 of them were ever made, yes only 3! It was based on the Aventador LP700-4 and was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Auto Show. As elusive and extremely rare as the Veneno is, Lamborghini's surprise wasn't done there.</h3></P>
<P><h3>Come on! 50th birthdays are far more special to end on such a subtle note for Lambo. So, they came up with the Veneno Roadster, but unlike 3 units of its hard-top brother, the Roadster was dialed up to 9 units, which was, for the record, still extremely exclusive. The mind-boggling perk of the Veneno is its insane aerodynamics. And it pops your eyes, even more, when the roof is of</h3></P>

<h3>Lamborghini Veneno was pitched in to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Italian automaker. 50 years of making mad cars could only have been complemented with a car that was their most outrageous yet, and the Veneno ticked all those boxes. Initially, the coupe model was released which was extremely rate at just 3 units.</h3>
<hr><h3>Then the Veneno Roadster came into being with 9 units to grab out for. Both the coupe and roadster shared all the same aspects except for the roof and differentiating c-pillar construction. For the record, the roadster wasn't offered even with an optional roof also, it was a truly roofless car!</h3></hr>
